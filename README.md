# SeshBuilder Web

The SeshBuilder consists of the SeshBuilder and the Pose Database. Using using existing yoga sequences as a template, I've designed SeshBuilder to
be a place where you can do 2 main things:
1) Add Poses to the pose database along with some optional criteria such as:
- target area
- breathing technique
- variant (side)
- variation (difficulty modifications)
- etc

2) Use the poses from the pose database to create sessions and sequences.

A Session is a list of sequences and a sequence is a list of poses

## How to use
Install and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Why use it?

SeshBuilder and Pose Database are meant to go hand in hand.
This web app solves the problem of writing your creative yoga and/or general fitness sequences down manually.

## Why it's different?

There are other sequence builder apps out there for yoga, but they do not allow you to upload your own poses.
What if you have a pose, or maybe a unique way of doing a pose that is not already in the other guys database?
